# DesolationMORPG
A MORPG project to teach myself databases and networking

Set in a post-apocalyptic future, Desolation is a Java-based MORPG semi-rougelike that aims to take the control away from the NPCs and allow the players to create their own society.

The client will use the libgdx Java library to provide the visuals. The server uses MongoDB to maintain the list of users and their characters.
